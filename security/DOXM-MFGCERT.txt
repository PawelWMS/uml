participant "On-boarding Tool" as OT
participant "New Device" as ND

==Device Owner Transfer Method==
note over OT, ND
Find new devices that are unowned and choose the Mfg-Cert owner transfer method
end note
OT->ND: GET /oic/sec/doxm?Owned="FALSE"
ND->OT: RSP [{"OxmType":"oic.sec.doxm.rdp", "Oxm":"0", "Owned":"FALSE", "DidFormat":"0", "DeviceID":"uuid:0000-0000-0000-0000",...}]
OT->ND: POST /oic/sec/doxm [{... "OxmSel": "oic.sec.doxm.mfgcert", ...}]
ND->OT: RSP 2.04
OT->ND: GET /oic/sec/pstat
ND->OT: RSP [{"IsOp":"FALSE", "Cm":"bx0011,1110, "Tm":"bx0011,1110,"Om":"bx0000,0000", "Sm":"bx0000,0011"}]
note over OT, ND
On-boarding tool tells new device how provisioning will be achieved.
end note
OT->ND: PUT /oic/sec/pstat [{...,"Om":"bx0000,0011", ...}]
ND->OT: RSP 2.04

==Perform oic.sec.doxm.mfgcert method==
note over OT, ND
The Mfg cert private key is used to sign handshake messages. Certificate attests device to OBT. If device requires authentication of the OBT, it will resolve the OBT certificate to its embedded trust anchor. Otherwise, it will implicitly trust the OBT.
end note
OT->ND: ClientHello(TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256)
ND->OT: HelloVerifyRequest(cookie)
OT->ND: ClientHello(cookie); 
ND->OT: ServerHello(); Certificate*, ServerKeyExchange(ECDH PublicKey + ECC Curve Param); ServerHelloDone()
OT->ND: Certificate*, ClientKeyExchange(ECDH PublicKey); ChangeCipherSpec + Finish
ND->OT:	ChangeCipherSpec + Finish

==The secure session is used for the remainder of the owner transfer process==
note over OT, ND
This protocol follows the generic example transfer method - refer to the Example Owner Transfer Method.
